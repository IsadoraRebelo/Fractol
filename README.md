## <b> Summary: </b><br>
This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
This project is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a fractal is.

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
- The second project of Codam (42 Network School) in the graphic branch, the full PDF can be found in this repository. <br>
- Makefile commands: 
```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```
- Usage: 
```
./fractol FractalName
```
<b> Fractals you can choose: </b>
> Mandelbrot <br>
> Julia <br>
> BurningShip

<b> Controls: </b>
> Move with arrows (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT). <br>
> Zoon in and out with the mouse scroll.<br>
> Reset the set with R.<br>
> ESC to quit the program.<p>
> <b>Three sets of colors, change with the following keys:</b><br>
> S = Standard.<br>
> P = Psychedelic.<br>
> B = Brazil.

<b> Controls Julia Set: </b>
> Move the mouse to change form. <br>
> Click to freeze, click again to unfreeze. 

<b>Ps:</b> The interaction value change when you zoon in and out. <br>
<b>Ps2:</b> The zoom follows the mouse position.
